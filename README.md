# Git-process
Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database.

## On your github, go to the plus sign on your top right
- create a repository use the same name you did on your project folder.

## In you terminal

``` touch README.md ```
### Initialise your git in your folder
``` git init ```
### The git add command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area
- git add doesn't really affect the repository in any significant wayâ€”changes are not actually recorded until you run git commit.
``` git add . ```

git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin git@github.com:alexpchin/<reponame>.git
git push -u origin master ```
